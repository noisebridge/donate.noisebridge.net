    <h3>Donate Now! Keep Noisebridge Hackerspace Alive in San Francisco!!</h3>
    <p>It costs $400 a day to keep NoiseBridge up and running. Please consider signing up for a monthly donation, reccuring revenue is the best way to keep us afloat. </p>
    <p>Remember! Any donations to Noisebridge are tax deductible as we are a 501(c)(3)</p>
    <br>
    <p>NoiseBridge is on the look out for a forever home. We're looking at several options for an accessible, industrial space close to public transit, but it's clear that whichever we choose, we're going to have to deal with a significant rent increase. PS. If you have a lead on a cheap industrial space near transit, please let us know ( secretary@noisebridge.net ).</p>
    <br>
    <p> Also, if you, or an organization you are a part of would like to discuss a larger donation or loan that could help us buy a building and ensure a permanent home for Noisebridge, please get in contact! (treasurer@noisebridge.net)</p>
